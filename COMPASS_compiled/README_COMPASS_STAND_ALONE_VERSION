Please follow the following instcutions to run the compiled version of COMPASS. This version allows using COMPASS independently of Matlab on a Linux 64 bit machine.


**Background**
COMPASS was compiled on Matlab R2012a for Linux 64bit.
The corresponding MCR was downloaded from the Matlab website (http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/MCR_R2012a_glnxa64_installer.zip). Please see installation below. The MCR is about 270Mb and needs about 880Mb.  

Currently, the compiled version automatically uses all cores of the machine. Future version will enable specifying a smaller number of cores. 

The compiled version uses the database stored in the (Matlab-based) COMPASS directory so please download the whole package even if you intend to use the compiled version.
 

** Installation instructions: **
The only installation refers to the MCR. Please do the following:
1) cd userDir/COMPASS/COMPASS_compiled/bin
where "userDir" is where the location of the COMPASS package. For example, in case COMPASS was saved under your home directory, then "userDir" is simply "~".
2) cat MCR_2012a.tgz_* | tar xz


** Example **
We provide an example of a single simulation, namely creating the reads and applying COMPASS. Please follow the file "example_of_a_single_simulation_COMPASS_compiled.txt"
